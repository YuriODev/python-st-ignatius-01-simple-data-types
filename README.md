## 📝 Module Overview

In this module, we'll explore the core fundamentals of Python, starting with **objects and variables**, continuing with **numbers** and **strings**, and culminating in **keyboard input**.

## 🧩 Topics Covered

### 1. Objects and Variables 🆔

Learn how Python uses **objects** and **variables** to store and manipulate data.

### 2. Numbers 🔢

Understand the different **numeric data types** in Python, such as **integers** and **floating-point numbers**, and how to use them in various operations.

- **Integers** ➖
   - Operations with integer types, including addition, subtraction, and more.
- **Floating-Point Numbers** 🌊
   - Operations with floating-point numbers and their precision limits.
- **Type Conversion** ↔
   - How to convert between integers and floating-point numbers.
- **Mathematical Functions** 🧮
   - Using Python's built-in mathematical functions for complex operations.

### 3. Strings 📝

Explore the world of **strings**—Python's way of representing textual data. We'll cover:

- **String Creation and Manipulation** ✍
- **String Formatting** 🎨
- **Escape Characters** 🎭
- **Concatenation and Slicing** 🔗

### 4. Boolean Values 🤔

Introduction to **boolean values** (`True` and `False`), their use in conditional statements, and **comparison operations**.

### 5. Data Input 🖥️

Learn how to capture **keyboard input** using Python's `input()` function.

### 6. Pythonic Tips ✨

Best practices for writing clean and efficient Python code, including **comments**, **indentation**, and **compound operators**.
